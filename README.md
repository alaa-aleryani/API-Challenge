# Python API Challenge
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions.
So to answer a fundamental question such as: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
We may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would we prove that?

This challenge is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

## WeatherPy
In this deliverable, we'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 
We used the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and our problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
To get started, an API key is required to generate the cities. To get your API key visit https://openweathermap.org/api. 

## VacationPy
In this deliverable, we used your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, we used Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
To get the API key for this part, visit https://myprojects.geoapify.com to get your own API key.
